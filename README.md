Othello or Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8ª8 uncheckered board.

The first four pieces go in the center of the board in a standard diagonal pattern.
Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color
During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color 
are turned over to the current player's color.
The object of the game is to have the majority of disks displaying your color when the last playable empty square is filled.
